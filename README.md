**Metis Marker** brings you the opportunity to create NATO joint military symbols after the *APP-6(C)* regulation.  
It allows to build symbols from components, including frame, icon, first modifier, second modifier and amplifiers, rather than pre-define all possible symbols.

## Features:
- Full customizable marker
- Moveable marker
- Editable/non-editable marker
- Build in preview
- Full 3DEN support (create, move, edit marker)
- Briefing support (create, move, edit marker)
- Communication channel support e.g. Global-, Side- or Groupchannel 

## Customizable marker system
Our customizable marker system consists of:  
- **Frames:** The geometric border of a symbol that provides an indication of the standard identity, battle dimension and status of a joint military object. *Currently only ground symbols are supported.*
- **Icons:** The innermost part of a symbol that provides a graphic representation of an object.
- **Modifiers:** A pictorial or alphanumeric component that provides additional information about the icon and are always located inside the frame area.
- **Amplifiers:** Optional text or graphics that provide additional information about a symbol and are always located outside the frame area. This includes:
    - Echelon
    - Reinforced or Reduced
    - Higher Formation
    - Unique Designation
